# Grocery-store-project-of-computer-organization-and-assembly-language
The Grocery Store Simulation project demonstrates the practical application of assembly language programming to simulate a simple grocery store scenario. The project includes key functionalities such as item listing, input handling, price calculation, and summary display. Through rigorous testing, we ensured the system's reliability and correctness. This project provided valuable insights into low-level programming and the use of the Irvine32 library.
